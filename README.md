# Image Colorization
The goal of our project is to perform automatic colorization of black and white images. Specifically, we aim to train a neural network that learns to map grayscale input images to their corresponding colored versions. In this setup, the predictors are the black and white images, and the labels are the fully colored versions of those same images.

Motivation
Colorizing black and white images is an important prediction task with both historical and practical significance. We believe this project could benefit a range of industries, particularly education assistance, historical archives, museums, and the media & film industry. For educational use in the medical field, colorizing images can enhance visualization and offer more accurate diagnostic information for doctors during clinical procedures compared to grayscale images.

In the context of museums and archives, AI powered colorization offers a compelling way to restore and reimagine old photographs, making them more engaging and accessible for modern audiences. Adding color not only enhances visual storytelling but also helps preserve cultural memory in a more immersive and relatable format.

In the media and film industry, this technology is often used to remaster classic films and footage for modern distribution. Whether it’s archivists preparing exhibitions or editors bringing old scenes back to life, being able to generate realistic color from grayscale images opens up space for both creative exploration and historical impact.

While image colorization is not a new concept, we believe that there is still a lot to uncover in this domain. Our approach brings a fresh angle in terms of both data and model design. Instead of relying on public datasets, we’re planning to use our own set of images and build a full deep learning pipeline from scratch. This allows us to take on a classic challenge in a customized approach.
